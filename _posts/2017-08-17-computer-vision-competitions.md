As an early stage researcher in Computer Vision, I was asked the question — Are than any Computer Vision Challenges other than the ones we find in Kaggle?

So, here I compiled a list of all the CV Challenges that have happened/been happening in the past few years. Though, some of them might have ended, it’s worth looking at them to either get a new perspective or improve a bit of something on them. It could be new data sets,new learning models,new challenge and so on.
